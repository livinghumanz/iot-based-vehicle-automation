# # self obstacle detecting vehicle 
i guess this is the first step taken to move towards automatic / self driving vehicles the above code drives a vehicle automatically and decides which direction to move depending on the obstacle position--> componrnts used are |--> ulreasonic sensor and servo motor to detect obstacle for 360* by sweeping the servomotor |--> two back motors for movement 

# # vehicle which automatically takes rest after certain duraton of runtime
this is the upgraded module of the selfdriving vehicle. vehicles get heated up during long run so to avoid ceasing of engine we must leave intervals during long run. an automated system is created through the ingine manual and to avoid ceasing of engine the user is intimated through led /lcd display before 10 - 20 minutes with count down for the vehicle to stop. the vehicle takes rest for some duration and the user is intimated a 10 minutes prior the start time for safe and unintrepted travel.
